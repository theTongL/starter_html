            <p>The name of the dog comes from the city where he's adopted, St. Luis. He was extremely scared of
                everything when he first arrived but after he is used to the new environment, that situation becomes
                a lot better. </p>
            <P>He really like to run on the grass and actually eating the grass. He likes to follow when we go for a
                walk instead of walking in the front to lead.</P>

            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days
                lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make
                friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to
                give chase.</p>
            <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He
                would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.
            </p>

            <p>Tietie is a two-and-a-half-year-old Ragdoll cat with long, white fur. He has a fondness for snacks, which
                has contributed to his rapid growth. He possesses a gentle and playful nature, enjoying interaction with
                people. However, he can also be a bit mischievous, as he often wakes his owner up every morning with his
                calls.</p>

            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He's energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
                people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long. </p>
            <p>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn't get a snack.</p>

            <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known
                Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry
                jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Vanilla</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator
                    to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.</li>
                <li>Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter.</li>
                <li>Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Continue swirling until the batter is just set.</li>
                <li>Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about
                    30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about
                    30 seconds. </li>
                <li>Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining
                    batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
                <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Japanese Chicken Curry</h2>
            <span><b>Origin:</b> Japan</span>
            <span><b>Source:</b> Family Recipe</span>
            <span><b>Category:</b> Main Dish</span>
            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It's an exemplary comfort food and
                one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
                <li>1 can peas</li>
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on
                    both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in
                    the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into
                    pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until
                    sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over
                    top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and
                    simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
                    and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've since tweaked her recipe to better
                suit my family's palate, making it less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the
